 <H3> <i>This week, we each made and decorated a skateboard. We went about this by using a strong glue to join together several thin pieces of wood to make the actual deck. After that, we vacuum-sealed the layers together to make an air-tight seal that would make sure the layers would stay together. Then we used several machines to sand down the edges of the board so that it would look neat. Then, I printed a large sticker of Kanye West performing and put it on the bottom of the deck and I cut off the excess sticker.</i></h3>
