 <H3> <i>This week, we focused on 3d printing and scanning. One thing that we did was we scanned our head and upper torso so that we'd be able to print it out after combining it with a sortof pedestal through software. I sent this .stl file of my head on a stand to Mr. Gerber, but for some reason it didn't get printed. I also had to 3d print an object that couldn't be made subtractively. I chose to make a hollow box with a ball in it. As you can see from the video linked below, there was indeed a ball in the box. Noah and I also made a drip irrigation cap for a water bottle. It fit on kinda tight but we eventually got it to fit and drip at a steady rate.</i></h3>
