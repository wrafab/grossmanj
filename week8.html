   <h3><i>This week we focused on soldering. We were assigned to solder a set of materials together to make a spinning LED wheel. I learned that soldering involves using an extremely hot pen melting a conductive metal so that you can join other conductive elements. For some reason, after I finished soldering my circuitboard, only the top LED would light up instead of the LEDs lighting up around the wheel one after another. I think I probably didn't solder one of the wires well enough to the circuitboard so it didn't serve its original purpose.</i><h3>
