 <H3> <i>For the first class this week, we were instructed to break into groups and create a device using straws, some string, tape, and a cup. The purpose of this device was to hold as many pennies as possible before collapsing. The straws weren't allowed to be attached to the cup via the tape. As one can see in our design below, my group broke this rule. </i></h3>
