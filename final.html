 <H3> <i>During the final week of Digital Engineering and Fabrication, everyone worked on their own personal final project. This project had to incorporate 4 processes that we worked on throughout the year. For my project, I decided to make a sign that featured my favorite sports team, the Houston Rockets. I vectored the Houston Rockets text at the top of the sign out of a piece of wood using CorelDraw and the laser printer. I also rastered "Back to back world champs: 1994, 1995" on the bottom of the sign using a similar process. Vectoring and rastering used two processes which were CAD and use of the laser printer. Then, I printed two stickers of Hakeem Olajuwon and James Harden and put them on the both sides of the top of the sign. This involved the vinyl printer as well as CorelDraw. I then 3d printed 2 stands for the sign so that it's able to stand upright on its own. I then glued 2 pieces of wood to the bottoms of the stands so that the top heavy sign wouldn't fall backward. I spent about 3 class periods working on the project, but it probably could have been about 2 if the laser printer were to vector properly in the final class. I learned from this project that although some of the processes that we learned in this class are simple by themselves, when you incorporate several processes into one project, you can make something much more complex and interesting.</i></h3>
